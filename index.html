            This is a place to iterate on this new theme. The goal is to
            replicate the limited capabilites of early computers, while also
            giving them a modern twist. I know‚Äîreal original‚Äîbut it's my theme

            This is a small theme, a baby if you will. I don't want to plan for

            is to just create examples as I need them and use that as the basis
            for this theme

          <p>
            Welcome to <a href="https://blair.pictures/">blair.pictures</a>!
            This is the first WordPress site I‚Äôve developed on my own. Until
            now, I‚Äôve mostly made static sites like
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or
            <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>. These frameworks
            offer a self-contained environment that can be run entirely through
            the terminal, which I‚Äôve always found easier to wrap my head around.
            I didn‚Äôt want to lose that with this site, so I created this (janky)
            setup to work around it!
          </p>
          <h2>Why use WordPress?</h2>
          <p>
            So why would I use WordPress if I like the toolchains of static
            sites so much? It really came down to images. Basically, the way you
            manage content on a static site is by committing files directly to a
            Git repository. This is fine for text-heavy sites, but it‚Äôs not
            great for sites like this that use lots of images. Your choices are
            to commit large, binary files to your git repo‚Äîwhich will quickly
            inflate its size‚Äîor to figure out another way of hosting these
            images.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though there are some options available, most of the easy-to-use
            solutions like Contentful, were fairly expensive. Meanwhile
            Dreamhost offered an inexpensive WordPress Hosting plan with
            unlimited storage. On top of that I would have an environment that I
            could access from several devices, which is really helpful since I
            do a lot of my drawing on my iPad. So with all those factors
            considered, I decided to bite the bullet and make a WordPress site!
          </p>
          <h2>Creating an Isolate Environment with Docker</h2>
          <p>
            With WordPress selected, I needed to figure out my local development
            environment. I always found this part intimidating. Unlike with a
            static site, where all you have to do is download some files and run
            some commands on the terminal, with WordPress you needto set up an
            entire LAMP stack! Tools like MAMP make easier, but I would always
            worried I‚Äôd leave some process running in the background, or I‚Äôd
            have trouble resetting the database. I wanted to be able to launch
            and teardown my environment easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tool I ended up turning to was Docker. I‚Äôve been using it a lot
            at work recently, and I liked its ability to create isolated,
            composable environments. Even better, there was already a WordPress
            Docker image, so creating an environment was as simple as creating a
            docker-compose.yaml file!
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, some of the functionality I wanted was a little verbose, and
            there were some gotchas‚Äîlike how to completely reset the database.
            To make these common functions a little easier to remember, I
            created some npm run scripts to simplify things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>launch</code> ‚Äì Setup the docker container using
              docker-compose
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>stop</code> ‚Äì Stop running the docker container (but leave
              everything in-tact)
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>teardown</code> ‚Äì Stop and remove all volumes associated
              with the site. Useful in case things get too out-of-hand and you
              want to start from scratch
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>ssh</code> ‚Äì Essentially just executes bash inside the
              docker container. Useful for when you want to explore the file
              system inside the image
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With these, I was able to create an isolated WordPress environment
            that I could setup and teardown at will!

          <h2>Setting Up Live Development</h2>
          <p>
            The next thing I needed to figure out was how to make changes to the
            site. My solution was to create 2 folders at the root of the
            environment, plugins and themes. The contents of these folders are
            .gitignored, so I could just git clone existing themes and plugins
            into them. Then, I created a new npm run script to copy those files
            into the container:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>build</code> ‚Äì copies the contents of plugins and themes
              into the appropriate location in the Docker container
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Still, this wasn‚Äôt great for getting immediate feedback. I wanted to
            be able to copy files into the container as I was editing them.
            Fortunately, I was able to do that with Gulp. Though I‚Äôve mostly
            moved to using Webpack for most of my JavaScript development, Gulp
            is really useful when all I want to do is run a command when my file
            changes. I stored this in another script:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>dev</code> ‚Äì runs build to copy the initial files over, then
              runs gulp to watch for changes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With that, I was able to see changes in real-time as I was making
            them! This solution might not scale if I need to start modifying
            other types of WordPress files, but it suits my needs for now. You
            can see the final environment setup in my comic-site-env repo.

          <h2>Pushing My Changes to Production</h2>
          <p>
            With the Basic WordPress plan, the WordPress environment is already
            setup, so when I‚Äôm ready to push my changes to production, I just
            upload my files on their web panel. This isn‚Äôt too difficult, since
            all my changes are limited to themes and plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm not super happy with how manual this step is, so I‚Äôd like to
            automate it using something like ssh and rsync in the future.
          </p>
          <h2>In Summary‚Ä¶</h2>
          <p>My local development workflow is the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Launch the site in a Docker container</li>
            <li>Copy themes and plugins into the container using Gulp</li>
            <li>Manually upload the changes when I‚Äôm done</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is admittedly a roundabout and hacky setup, but I‚Äôm happy with
            how I‚Äôm able to keep everything self-contained and controlled with
            terminal commands! I haven‚Äôt hit any major pain-points with this
            setup‚Äîin fact I‚Äôm able to do a lot more customization without
            working with code. Still I‚Äôm hoping to keep updating and refining
            this process.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are your thoughts on this setup? Do you have any janky setups
            you‚Äôd like to share? Is there anything you‚Äôd like me to write about
            next? Leave a comment and let me know!
